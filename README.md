# 🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program — VSD  

Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)**!  
This repository documents my **week-by-week progress**, tasks, and key learnings as part of **India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative**, empowering **3500+ participants** to design silicon and strengthen the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.

## 📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tools  

| Task   | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Task 0 | 🛠️ Tools Installation — Installed Icarus Verilog (iverilog), Yosys, and GTKWave | ✅ Done |

### 🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0
- Successfully installed and verified **open-source EDA tools**.  
- Understood the **basic environment setup** for RTL design and synthesis.  
- Prepared the system for upcoming **RTL → GDSII flow experiments**.
